Benchy Speed and Quality Testing
Look at the print date to see most recent tests, older test will have notes that are outdated (i.e. IS, PA, and flow rate have all been tuned at this point)

|  24v@1.4a  | 14k,450mm/s,5scv  |  14:30 |  .... | 2025-12-12  |More Ringing, flaws on top layers, signigigant pressure advance artificats. | Tune IS, flow rate, and PA. |
|  24v@1.6a  | 25k,500mm/s,15scv |  9:48  |  .... | 2025-12-12  | Major Ringing, top layer issues, undercooling, and wall artificats. | Tune IS, flow rate, and PA. |
|  24v@1.8a  | 25k,500mm/s,15scv |  7:28  |  .... | 2025-12-18  | Major tuning done, only issues is at seam, bow overhang and with stringing. | tune retract and overhang speeds |
